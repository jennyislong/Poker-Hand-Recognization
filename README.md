# Poker-Hand-Recognization
This Program Identifies and returns what kind of poker hand is represented 

A Hand consists of 5 cards which is represented by a 10 character long string.

The first character represents the rank of the card (number i.e. 2) and the second character represents the suits, which is either "cdhs" (clubs, diamonds, heart or spades).

Poker Hands:

        1)Four of a Kind -four cards have same rank
        2) Full House - two cards have one same rank and three other cards have another same rank
        3) Flush -  all five cards have the same suit
        4) Three of a kind - three cards have the same rank
        5) Pair - two cards have the same rank
        6) <Highest Rank > high- none of 1-5 works ,so you return just the 
        highest rank in the hand followed by the word 'high' i.e. '9 high'
